This is for Scav 2023 Showcase item 226 page 13 for Upsilon Nu

The prompt is:
We're no longer making Hogwarts Houses part of our personality. We are making our Warrior Cats Clans part of our personality. In lieu of a. Sorting Hat, create some other garment or accessory, suitable for any full moon Gathering, that will use the wearer's meow(s) to sort them into the appropriate Clan. Its replicable, non-random verdict should be delivered via a mechanism impressively integrated into the item. Remember- a. warrior must be ready to defend their garment, so come prepared to explain your completion. [120 points, bonus points if it gives each wearer a unique Warrior Name]

The best way to use this code is to open ipython3 and type

import warrio_cat

s = s = warrio_cat.Sorting_Hat()
s.sort()

note the code will record for 3 seconds if you'd like to change the duration of
meowing type

duration = 10
s.sort(duration)
